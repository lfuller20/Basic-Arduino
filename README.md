## Blink Led
Description:
  In this assignment, I revisited my knowledge of Arduino by wiring a circuit and writing code that caused an LED to illuminate for a set amount of time and turn off for a set amount of time, causing it to blink.

Obstacle I Faced:
  I faced many obstacles throughout this project due to the fact that it was the first project I had done since the start of the school year. One issue in particular was the writing of the code.
## Hello LCD 
Description: 
  In this assignment, I was introduced to LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays). An LCD is a flat-panel display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals. We learned how to saughter wires to the pads and wired our LCD to a breadboard in order to make the LCD display a phrase, such as, "Hello, World!"

Obstacle I Faced: 
  During this project, I had some trouble coding the LCD because I had never worked with an LCD before. I wasn't aware that I had to install the Liquid Crystal Display library, but after receiving assistance, I was successfully able to complete my project. 
## LCD Backpack
Description:
  In this assignment, I again used an LCD, but this time added an LCD backpack to the back of the LCD, hence the name, to make the project easier and more practical. The LCD backpack reduced the amount of pins used from six digital Arduino pins to two analog pins. Using my new and improved LCD circuit, I made my LCD display a message saying, "Button Presses:". When a pressed a button within my circuit, the number of button presses was displayed on my LCD.

Obstacle I Faced: 
  At first, I had an issue getting the LCD to display the correct number of button presses, but after researching the problem and receivng help, I resolved my issue and my circuit worked. 
## Motor Control
Description: 
  In this assignment, I was asked to make a motor spin at different speeds using a potentiometer. By using an arduino, a breadboard, a potentiometer, and a DC motor, I created a circuit. The
