# Intermediate Arduino
## Blink Led
Description:
  In this assignment, I revisited my knowledge of Arduino by wiring a circuit and writing code that caused an LED to illuminate for a set amount of time and turn off for a set amount of time, causing it to blink.

Obstacle I Faced:
  I faced many obstacles throughout this project due to the fact that it was the first project I had done since the start of the school year. One issue in particular was the writing of the code.
## Hello LCD 
Description: 
  In this assignment, I was introduced to LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays). An LCD is a flat-panel display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals. We learned how to saughter wires to the pads and wired our LCD to a breadboard in order to make the LCD display a phrase, such as, "Hello, World!"
