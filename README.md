## Blink Led
Description:
  In this assignment, I revisited my knowledge of Arduino by wiring a circuit and writing code that caused an LED to illuminate for a set amount of time and turn off for a set amount of time, causing it to blink.

Obstacle I Faced:
  I faced many obstacles throughout this project due to the fact that it was the first project I had done since the start of the school year. One issue in particular was the writing of the code.
## Hello LCD 
Description: 
  In this assignment, I was introduced to LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays). An LCD is a flat-panel display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals. We learned how to saughter wires to the pads and wired our LCD to a breadboard in order to make the LCD display a phrase, such as, "Hello, World!"

Obstacle I Faced: 
  During this project, I had some trouble coding the LCD because I had never worked with an LCD before. I wasn't aware that I had to install the Liquid Crystal Display library, but after receiving assistance, I was successfully able to complete my project. 
## LCD Backpack
Description:
  In this assignment, I again used an LCD, but this time added an LCD backpack to the back of the LCD, hence the name, to make the project easier and more practical. The LCD backpack reduced the amount of pins used from six digital Arduino pins to two analog pins. Using my new and improved LCD circuit, I made my LCD display a message saying, "Button Presses:". When a pressed a button within my circuit, the number of button presses was displayed on my LCD.

Obstacle I Faced: 
  At first, I had an issue getting the LCD to display the correct number of button presses, but after researching the problem and receivng help, I resolved my issue and my circuit worked. 
## Motor Control
Description: 
  In this assignment, I was asked to make a motor spin at different speeds using a potentiometer. By using an arduino, a breadboard, a potentiometer, and a DC motor, I created a circuit that manipulated the speed at which a motor spun, depending on how far a potentiometer was turned.

Obstacle I faced: 
  I had some trouble mapping the value of the potentiometer because I was not aware of how to code my potentiometer to do so. I looked up some instructions on how to go about solving my issue and doing so, I was able to resolve my problem. The wiring for this project was also slightly tricky, however, by using smaller wires, I reduced the amount of excess wire in my circuit, making it easier for me to navigate my circuit. 
## NewPing 
Description:
  In this assignment, I was instructed to make something cool happen using an Ultrasonic Sensor. Using our knowledge that we acquired about functions, I was to code and wire a circuit that would illuminate an LED depending on how far away something was from an Ultrasonic sensor. I made my program so that after an object got 5 meters away from the sensor, the LED would illuminate.

Obstacle I faced: 
  When I began working on this project, I had little knowledge about functions. Throughout and after working on this project, my knowlege of functions increased greatly. But even still, after strengthening my knowledge of functions, I still struggled slightly. I had trouble coding my program so that the LED lit up after the correct distance. At first, the LED lit when I placed my hand directly in front of the sensor, it lit up. But after doing some research I figured out my issue and was able to complete my project. 
## Photointerrupters
Description:
  In this assignment, I created a circuit that illuminated an LED when I put something in between the sensors of a photointerruptor. When coding my project, I could either use RISING or FALLING, I chose to use RISING. RISING is used when listening to what type of change you want to listen for, specifically when the pin goes from LOW to HIGH.

Obstacle I faced:
  Throughout this project, I really struggled with the coding. I was puzzled by the new commands being introduced to me. Since I had never used attachInterrupt and RISING/FALLING commands before, they were very tricky. However, after recieving some assistance, I was able to comprehend their use and complete my project. 
## Potentiometers
Description: 
  In this assignment, I was introduced to potentiometers. Potentiometers allow you to control the voltage traveling through a circuit. We were asked to make a LED illuminate and different brightnesses depending on how far the potentiometer was turned. In addition, we used an LCD screen to display a message stating the current brightness at that point in time.

Obstacle I faced:
  I had one main problem when completing this project: coding the potentiometer. I struggle with coding, and having to include these functions that were very confusing to me did not make my task any easier. Mapping the values of the brightness was difficult however, I was able to overcome these obstacles and complete my project. 
  
## Ultrasonic Sensor 
Description:
  In this assignment, I was instructed to make something happen depending on how far away an object was from a sensor. In order to do so, I used an Ultrasonic Sensor and a servo. I chose to make a servo turn different directions depending on how far away something was from my Ultrasonic sensor.

Obstacle I faced:
  During this project, I faced a couple of short lived obstacles, in addition to one large one. The less significant obstacles were wiring issues that I easily fixed. However, the larger issue was coding this project. Coding the if and else statements regarding the servo tripped me up, as well as writing the getDistance command. 
## Button Presses 
Description:
  In this assignment, I constructed a circuit that counted the number of times that a button was pressed. I completed this project using a button, a breadboard, some wires, and an LCD screen. 

Commented Code:
## Fade LED
